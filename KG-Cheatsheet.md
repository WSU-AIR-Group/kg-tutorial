# Knowledge Graph Tutorial
## Definitions:

**Knowledge Graphs:**  Representation of linked data where nodes and edges represent the relationship connections between classes/objects

**Ontology:** Acts as a blueprint for KGs;  Formal specification for Knowledge Graphs by asserting axioms

**Axioms:**  Constraints to how classes/objects connect with relationships/properties
Narrative

**Use-Case:** The problem to be addressed; the use case descriptions can also describe existing data sources that the ontology needs to be able to represent or align against, if any.

**Competency Questions:** Examples for queries of interest, expressed in natural language, that should be answerable from the data graph with which the ontology would be populated. Competency questions help to refine the use-case scenario, and can also aid as a sanity check on the adequacy of the data sources for the use case.

**SPARQL:** Querying language for knowledge graphs.

**Web Ontology Language (OWL):** W3C Recommendation for describing the semantic web.

**Resource Description Framework (RDF):** Standard Language for data representation on the web.
